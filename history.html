                            Augustus, first emperor of the Roman Empire, considered conquest beyond the Rhine and the Danube not 
                            only regular foreign policy but also necessary to counter Germanic incursions into a still rebellious 
                            Gaul. A series of forts and commercial centers were established along the two rivers. Some tribes, 
                            such as the Ubii consequently allied with Rome and readily adopted advanced Roman culture. During the 
                            1st century CE Roman legions conducted extended campaigns into Germania magna, the area north of the 
                            Upper Danube and east of the Rhine, attempting to subdue the various tribes. Roman ideas of 
                            administration, the imposition of taxes and a legal framework were frustrated by the total absence 
                            of an infrastructure. The campaigns of Germanicus, for example were almost exclusively characterized 
                            by frequent massacres of villagers and indiscriminate pillaging. The tribes, however maintained 
                            their elusive identities. In 9 AD a coalition of tribes under the Cherusci chieftain Arminius, who 
                            was familiar with Roman tactical doctrines, defeated a sizeable Roman force in the Battle of the 
                            Teutoburg Forest. Consequently, Rome resolved to permanently establish the Rhine/Danube border and 
                            refrain from further territorial advance into Germania. By AD 100 the frontier along the 
                            Rhine and the Danube and the Limes Germanicus was firmly established. Several Germanic tribes lived 
                            under Roman rule south and west of the border, as described in Tacitus's Germania. These lands 
                            represent the modern states Baden-Württemberg, southern Bavaria, southern Hesse, Saarland and the 
                            Rhineland. Austria formed the regular provinces of Noricum and Raetia. The provinces 
                            Germania Inferior (with the capital situated at Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium, modern Cologne) 
                            and Germania Superior (with its capital at Mogontiacum, modern Mainz), were formally established in 
                            85 AD, after long and painful campaigns as lasting military control was confined to the lands surrounding 
                            the rivers. Christianity was introduced to Roman controlled western Germania well before the 
                            Middle Ages, with Christian religious structures such as the Aula Palatina of Trier built during the 
                            reign of Constantine I (r. 306-337 AD).

                                    In 936, Otto I was crowned German king at Aachen, in 961 King of Italy in Pavia and crowned 
                                    emperor by Pope John XII in Rome in 962. The tradition of the German King as protector of the 
                                    Kingdom of Italy and the Latin Church resulted in the term Holy Roman Empire in the 12th century. 
                                    The name, that was to identify with Germany continued to be used officially, with the extension 
                                    added: Nationis Germanicæ (of the German nation) after the last imperial coronation in Rome in 
                                    1452 until its dissolution in 1806. Otto strengthened the royal authority by re-asserting 
                                    the old Carolingian rights over ecclesiastical appointments. Otto wrested from the nobles the 
                                    powers of appointment of the bishops and abbots, who controlled large land holdings. Additionally, 
                                    Otto revived the old Carolingian program of appointing missionaries in the border lands. Otto 
                                    continued to support celibacy for the higher clergy, so ecclesiastical appointments never became 
                                    hereditary. By granting lands to the abbots and bishops he appointed, Otto actually turned these 
                                    bishops into "princes of the Empire" (Reichsfürsten). In this way, Otto was able to establish 
                                    a national church. Outside threats to the kingdom were contained with the decisive defeat of the 
                                    Hungarian Magyars at the Battle of Lechfeld in 955. The Slavs between the Elbe and the Oder rivers 
                                    were also subjugated. Otto marched on Rome and drove John XII from the papal throne and for years 
                                    controlled the election of the pope, setting a firm precedent for imperial control of the papacy 
                                    for years to come.<br>
                                    During the reign of Conrad II's son, Henry III (1039 to 1056), the empire supported the Cluniac 
                                    reforms of the Church, the Peace of God, prohibition of simony (the purchase of clerical offices), 
                                    and required celibacy of priests. Imperial authority over the Pope reached its peak. However, Rome 
                                    reacted with the creation of the College of Cardinals and Pope Gregory VII's series of clerical 
                                    reforms. Pope Gregory insisted in his Dictatus Papae on absolute papal authority over appointments 
                                    to ecclesiastical offices. The subsequent conflict in which emperor Henry IV was compelled to 
                                    submit to the Pope at Canossa in 1077, after having been excommunicated came to be known as the 
                                    Investiture Controversy. In 1122, a temporary reconciliation was reached between Henry V and the 
                                    Pope with the Concordat of Worms. With the conclusion of the dispute the Roman church and the 
                                    papacy regained supreme control over all religious affairs. Consequently, the imperial 
                                    Ottonian church system (Reichskirche) declined. It also ended the royal/imperial tradition of 
                                    appointing selected powerful clerical leaders to counter the Imperial secular princes.
                                    Between 1095 and 1291 the various campaigns of the crusades to the Holy Land took place. 
                                    Knightly religious orders were established, including the Knights Templar, the Knights of 
                                    St John (Knights Hospitaller), and the Teutonic Order.<br>
                                    The term sacrum imperium (Holy Empire) was first used officially by Friedrich I in 1157, but the 
                                    words Sacrum Romanum Imperium, Holy Roman Empire, were only combined in July 1180 and would never 
                                    consistently appear on official documents from 1254 onwards.

                                    The 1618 to 1648 Thirty Years' War, that took place almost exclusively in the Holy Roman Empire 
                                    has its origins, which remain widely debated, in the unsolved and recurring conflicts of the 
                                    Catholic and Protestant factions. The Catholic emperor Ferdinand II attempted to achieve the 
                                    religious and political unity of the empire, while the opposing Protestant Union forces were 
                                    determined to defend their religious rights. The religious motive served as the universal 
                                    justification for the various territorial and foreign princes, who over the course of several 
                                    stages joined either of the two warring parties in order to gain land and power.<br>
                                    The conflict was sparked by the revolt of the Protestant nobility of Bohemia against emperor 
                                    Matthias' succession policies. After imperial triumph at the Battle of White Mountain and a 
                                    short-lived peace, the war grew to become a political European conflict by the intervention 
                                    of King Christian IV of Denmark from 1625 to 1630, Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden from 1630 to 
                                    1648 and France under Cardinal Richelieu from 1635 to 1648. The conflict increasingly evolved 
                                    into a struggle between the French House of Bourbon and the House of Habsburg for predominance 
                                    in Europe, for which the central German territories of the empire served as the battleground.<br>
                                    The war ranks among the most catastrophic in history as three decades of constant warfare and 
                                    destruction had left the land devastated. Marauding armies incessantly pillaged the countryside, 
                                    seized and levied heavy taxes on cities and indiscriminately plundered the food stocks of the 
                                    peasantry. There were also the countless bands of murderous outlaws, sick, homeless, disrupted 
                                    people and invalid soldiery. Overall social and economic disruption caused a dramatic decline in 
                                    population as a result of pandemic murder and random rape and killings, endemic infectious 
                                    diseases, crop failures, famine, declining birth rates, wanton burglary, witch-hunts and the 
                                    emigration of terrified people. Estimates vary between a 38% drop from 16 million people in 1618 
                                    to 10 million by 1650 and a mere 20% drop from 20 million to 16 million. The Altmark and 
                                    Württemberg regions were especially hard hit, where it took generations to fully recover.<br>
                                    The war was the last major religious struggle in mainland Europe and ended in 1648 with the 
                                    Peace of Westphalia. It resulted in increased autonomy for the constituent states of the Holy 
                                    Roman Empire, limiting the power of the emperor. Most of Alsace was ceded to France, Western 
                                    Pomerania and Bremen-Verden were given to Sweden as Imperial fiefs, and the Netherlands officially 
                                    left the Empire.

                                    Great Britain approved of the union, convinced that a stable, peaceful entity in central Europe 
                                    could discourage aggressive moves by France or Russia. Most historians, however, concluded, that 
                                    the Confederation was weak and ineffective and an obstacle to German nationalism. The union was
                                     undermined by the creation of the Zollverein in 1834, the 1848 revolutions, the rivalry between 
                                     Prussia and Austria and was finally dissolved in the wake of the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, 
                                     to be replaced by the North German Confederation during the same year.

                                    Chancellor Otto von Bismarck determined the political course of the German Empire until 1890. 
                                    He fostered alliances in Europe to contain France on the one hand and aspired to consolidate 
                                    Germany's influence in Europe on the other. His principal domestic policies focused on the 
                                    suppression of socialism and the reduction of the strong influence of the Roman Catholic Church 
                                    on its adherents. He issued a series of anti-socialist laws in accord with a set of social laws, 
                                    that included universal health care, pension plans and other social security programs. His 
                                    Kulturkampf policies were vehemently resisted by Catholics, who organized political opposition 
                                    in the Center Party (Zentrum). German industrial and economic power had grown to match Britain by 
                                    1900.<br>
                                    In 1888, the young and ambitious Kaiser Wilhelm II became emperor. He rejected advice from 
                                    experienced politicians and ordered Bismarck's resignation in 1890. He opposed Bismarck's 
                                    careful and delicate foreign policy and was determined to pursue colonialist policies, as Britain 
                                    and France had been doing for centuries. The Kaiser promoted the active colonization of Africa 
                                    and Asia for the lands that were not already colonies of other European powers. The Kaiser took 
                                    a mostly unilateral approach in Europe only allied with the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and embarked 
                                    on a dangerous naval arms race with Britain. His aggressive and erroneous policies greatly 
                                    contributed to the situation in which the assassination of the Austrian-Hungarian crown prince 
                                    would spark off World War I.
