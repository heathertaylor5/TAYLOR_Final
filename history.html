                            Augustus, first emperor of the Roman Empire, considered conquest beyond the Rhine and the Danube not 
                            only regular foreign policy but also necessary to counter Germanic incursions into a still rebellious 
                            Gaul. A series of forts and commercial centers were established along the two rivers. Some tribes, 
                            such as the Ubii consequently allied with Rome and readily adopted advanced Roman culture. During the 
                            1st century CE Roman legions conducted extended campaigns into Germania magna, the area north of the 
                            Upper Danube and east of the Rhine, attempting to subdue the various tribes. Roman ideas of 
                            administration, the imposition of taxes and a legal framework were frustrated by the total absence 
                            of an infrastructure. The campaigns of Germanicus, for example were almost exclusively characterized 
                            by frequent massacres of villagers and indiscriminate pillaging. The tribes, however maintained 
                            their elusive identities. In 9 AD a coalition of tribes under the Cherusci chieftain Arminius, who 
                            was familiar with Roman tactical doctrines, defeated a sizeable Roman force in the Battle of the 
                            Teutoburg Forest. Consequently, Rome resolved to permanently establish the Rhine/Danube border and 
                            refrain from further territorial advance into Germania. By AD 100 the frontier along the 
                            Rhine and the Danube and the Limes Germanicus was firmly established. Several Germanic tribes lived 
                            under Roman rule south and west of the border, as described in Tacitus's Germania. These lands 
                            represent the modern states Baden-Württemberg, southern Bavaria, southern Hesse, Saarland and the 
                            Rhineland. Austria formed the regular provinces of Noricum and Raetia. The provinces 
                            Germania Inferior (with the capital situated at Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium, modern Cologne) 
                            and Germania Superior (with its capital at Mogontiacum, modern Mainz), were formally established in 
                            85 AD, after long and painful campaigns as lasting military control was confined to the lands surrounding 
                            the rivers. Christianity was introduced to Roman controlled western Germania well before the 
                            Middle Ages, with Christian religious structures such as the Aula Palatina of Trier built during the 
                            reign of Constantine I (r. 306-337 AD).

                                    In 936, Otto I was crowned German king at Aachen, in 961 King of Italy in Pavia and crowned 
                                    emperor by Pope John XII in Rome in 962. The tradition of the German King as protector of the 
                                    Kingdom of Italy and the Latin Church resulted in the term Holy Roman Empire in the 12th century. 
                                    The name, that was to identify with Germany continued to be used officially, with the extension 
                                    added: Nationis Germanicæ (of the German nation) after the last imperial coronation in Rome in 
                                    1452 until its dissolution in 1806. Otto strengthened the royal authority by re-asserting 
                                    the old Carolingian rights over ecclesiastical appointments. Otto wrested from the nobles the 
                                    powers of appointment of the bishops and abbots, who controlled large land holdings. Additionally, 
                                    Otto revived the old Carolingian program of appointing missionaries in the border lands. Otto 
                                    continued to support celibacy for the higher clergy, so ecclesiastical appointments never became 
                                    hereditary. By granting lands to the abbots and bishops he appointed, Otto actually turned these 
                                    bishops into "princes of the Empire" (Reichsfürsten). In this way, Otto was able to establish 
                                    a national church. Outside threats to the kingdom were contained with the decisive defeat of the 
                                    Hungarian Magyars at the Battle of Lechfeld in 955. The Slavs between the Elbe and the Oder rivers 
                                    were also subjugated. Otto marched on Rome and drove John XII from the papal throne and for years 
                                    controlled the election of the pope, setting a firm precedent for imperial control of the papacy 
                                    for years to come.<br>
                                    During the reign of Conrad II's son, Henry III (1039 to 1056), the empire supported the Cluniac 
                                    reforms of the Church, the Peace of God, prohibition of simony (the purchase of clerical offices), 
                                    and required celibacy of priests. Imperial authority over the Pope reached its peak. However, Rome 
                                    reacted with the creation of the College of Cardinals and Pope Gregory VII's series of clerical 
                                    reforms. Pope Gregory insisted in his Dictatus Papae on absolute papal authority over appointments 
                                    to ecclesiastical offices. The subsequent conflict in which emperor Henry IV was compelled to 
                                    submit to the Pope at Canossa in 1077, after having been excommunicated came to be known as the 
                                    Investiture Controversy. In 1122, a temporary reconciliation was reached between Henry V and the 
                                    Pope with the Concordat of Worms. With the conclusion of the dispute the Roman church and the 
                                    papacy regained supreme control over all religious affairs. Consequently, the imperial 
                                    Ottonian church system (Reichskirche) declined. It also ended the royal/imperial tradition of 
                                    appointing selected powerful clerical leaders to counter the Imperial secular princes.
                                    Between 1095 and 1291 the various campaigns of the crusades to the Holy Land took place. 
                                    Knightly religious orders were established, including the Knights Templar, the Knights of 
                                    St John (Knights Hospitaller), and the Teutonic Order.<br>
                                    The term sacrum imperium (Holy Empire) was first used officially by Friedrich I in 1157, but the 
                                    words Sacrum Romanum Imperium, Holy Roman Empire, were only combined in July 1180 and would never 
                                    consistently appear on official documents from 1254 onwards.
