                            Augustus, first emperor of the Roman Empire, considered conquest beyond the Rhine and the Danube not 
                            only regular foreign policy but also necessary to counter Germanic incursions into a still rebellious 
                            Gaul. A series of forts and commercial centers were established along the two rivers. Some tribes, 
                            such as the Ubii consequently allied with Rome and readily adopted advanced Roman culture. During the 
                            1st century CE Roman legions conducted extended campaigns into Germania magna, the area north of the 
                            Upper Danube and east of the Rhine, attempting to subdue the various tribes. Roman ideas of 
                            administration, the imposition of taxes and a legal framework were frustrated by the total absence 
                            of an infrastructure. The campaigns of Germanicus, for example were almost exclusively characterized 
                            by frequent massacres of villagers and indiscriminate pillaging. The tribes, however maintained 
                            their elusive identities. In 9 AD a coalition of tribes under the Cherusci chieftain Arminius, who 
                            was familiar with Roman tactical doctrines, defeated a sizeable Roman force in the Battle of the 
                            Teutoburg Forest. Consequently, Rome resolved to permanently establish the Rhine/Danube border and 
                            refrain from further territorial advance into Germania. By AD 100 the frontier along the 
                            Rhine and the Danube and the Limes Germanicus was firmly established. Several Germanic tribes lived 
                            under Roman rule south and west of the border, as described in Tacitus's Germania. These lands 
                            represent the modern states Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, southern Bavaria, southern Hesse, Saarland and the 
                            Rhineland. Austria formed the regular provinces of Noricum and Raetia. The provinces 
                            Germania Inferior (with the capital situated at Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium, modern Cologne) 
                            and Germania Superior (with its capital at Mogontiacum, modern Mainz), were formally established in 
                            85 AD, after long and painful campaigns as lasting military control was confined to the lands surrounding 
                            the rivers. Christianity was introduced to Roman controlled western Germania well before the 
                            Middle Ages, with Christian religious structures such as the Aula Palatina of Trier built during the 
                            reign of Constantine I (r. 306-337 AD).
